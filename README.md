# Galaga
Implementation of Galaga in C for a GBA emulator

Upon running the game using "make vba" you can start playing the game by hitting the start button (Enter). To play the game, use the arrow keys and press A (Z) to fire a laser. You get to the next level by shooting all of the enemies while you lose a life if you collide with an enemy. Upon finishing all of the levels, you can restart the game by hitting the start button (Enter) or you can restart the game at any time by hitting the select button (Backspace).
